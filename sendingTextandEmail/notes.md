## points
- If you’re automating
a task that takes a couple of hours to do, you don’t want to go back to your
computer every few minutes to check on the program’s status. Instead, the
program can just text your phone when it’s done—freeing you to focus on
more important things while you’re away from your computer.

**Gmail’s Application-Specific Passwords**

- Gmail has an additional security feature for Google accounts called application-
specific passwords . If you receive an Application-specific password required
error message when your program tries to log in, you will have to set up one
of these passwords for your Python script. Check out the resources at http://­
nostarch.com/automatestuff/ for detailed directions on how to set up an applica-
tion-specific password for your Google account.
